## General Information
- This is a multi class classification problem on Skin Cancer dataset
- The business probem that the project is trying to solve is to classify skin cancer images into multiple classes
- The dataset that is being used is ISIC Dataset (Skin Cancer dataset)

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- I got a maximum test accuracy of 0.44 on the multi class classification problem on the skin cancer ISIC dataset with a run of data augmentation to training data. Without data augmentation run the maximum accuracy obtained was of 0.33.
